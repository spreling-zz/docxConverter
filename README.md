# Docx Converter
This is a rather old library. I created it for a school project and was built for office 2010 and 2013. It converts most of the basic properties but not the more advanced stuf like tabels. 

I don't have use for it annymore and i have used it in like three year. But I wouldn't let the code go to wast. So feel free to use the code and continue to build with it. maybe check if it still works with 2016.

Let me know if you want to take a look at it. Maybe can I be of assistant in any way.

O and the code is well document. So check inside to see how you need to use it.
